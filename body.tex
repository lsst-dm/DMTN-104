\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Obective}

The objective is to provide a clear picture on the DM management products, including description, characterizationa and dependencies.

\subsection{Definitions}

Following definitions are relevant for this document.

\subsubsection{Product} \label{sec:product}

A product is a component of the DM product tree, that contribute to sattisfy the DM requirements.

Each product is characterize by:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Name}: it is the main identification of the product. In some cases a \textit{short name} can be provided for documentation purposes.
\item \textbf{Unique Key}: it is a unique string mainly for programmatical usage. The product manager/owner can provide one, or it will be assigned by the Architecture team.
\item \textbf{Owner}: who is responsible for the quality and acceptance of a particular product (\citeds{LDM-294} \S6.6).
\item \textbf{Manager}: {T/CAM} who has managerial and financial responsibility for the engineering teams within DM (\citeds{LDM-294} \S6.14.1).
\item \textbf{WBS}: the WBS identification.
\item \textbf{Team}: the team in wich the product is developed.
\item \textbf{Description}: it provides a short over view of the product purpose.
\end{itemize}

Each product is included in the product tree following a type categorization (see nect \ref{sec:ptree}).

It should also be possible to specify for each product, which are the other products that are implementing it, and in which other products it is used for their implementation.


\subsubsection{Software Product} \label{sec:swproduct}

Please refer to \citeds{DMTN-106} section \$2 for the Software Product definition.


\subsubsection{Product Tree} \label{sec:ptree}

The product tree is the rappresentation of the DM products, categorized per type and grouped per similar application.


\subsubsection{Dependencies} \label{sec:dependencies}

The dependencies listed in this document are functional dependencies.
The aim is to provide, for each product, the list of other products needed for its implementation or execution. 


\subsection{Applicable Documents}

Following documents are applicable:

\citeds{LDM-294} Data Management Organization and Management\\
\citeds{LDM-148} Data Management System Design

\subsection{Document Overview}

In \ref{sect:top} the list of top level products is provided.
In \ref{sect:low} the list of low level products is provided.
In \ref{sect:sups} the list of supporting software is provided.


\newpage
\section{Top Level Product Tree}\label{sect:top}

The products listed in this section are maintained in MagicDraw by the DM System Enineering group. 

These products are meant to be operational, i.e. will process LSST source data and produce L1 or L2 data products, or will be distributed to permit the external collaborators and the science community to provide their contribution to the project.

\subsection{Data Management Top Level Product}\label{sec:dmtop}

\input{toplevel1}

\newpage
\section{Low Level Product Tree}\label{sect:low}

The products listed in this section are software packages in github.
All information is derived from github content.

These products are implementing mainly the top level \textit{software} products listed in previous \ref{sect:top} and in following \ref{sect:sups}

\input{swProducts}

\section{Supporting products}\label{sect:sups}

The list of products here is not meant to be used for operational puposes, but for supporting all activities involved in the development and maintenance of the operational products. 

These products are organized and maintained in MagicDraw by the DM System Engineering group.
