\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Obective}

The objective is to provide a clear picture on the DM management products, including description, characterizationa and dependencies.

\subsection{Definitions}

Following definitions are relevant for this document.

\subsubsection{Product} \label{sec:product}

A product is a component of the DM product tree, that contribute to sattisfy the DM requirements.

Each product is characterize by:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Name}: it is the main identification of the product. In some cases a \textit{short name} can be provided for documentation purposes.
\item \textbf{Unique Key}: it is a unique string mainly for programmatical usage. The product manager/owner can provide one, or it will be assigned by the Architecture team.
\item \textbf{Owner}: who is responsible for the quality and acceptance of a particular product (\citeds{LDM-294} \S6.6).
\item \textbf{Manager}: {T/CAM} who has managerial and financial responsibility for the engineering teams within DM (\citeds{LDM-294} \S6.14.1).
\item \textbf{WBS}: the WBS identification.
\item \textbf{Team}: the team in wich the product is developed.
\item \textbf{Description}: it provides a short over view of the product purpose.
\end{itemize}

Each product is included in the product tree following a type categorization (see nect \ref{sec:ptree}).

It should also be possible to specify for each product, which are the other products that are implementing it, and in which other products it is used for their implementation.


\subsubsection{Software Product} \label{sec:swproduct}

Please refer to \citeds{DMTN-106} section \$2 for the Software Product definition.


\subsubsection{Product Tree} \label{sec:ptree}

The product tree is the rappresentation of the DM products, categorized per type and grouped per similar application.


\subsubsection{Dependencies} \label{sec:dependencies}

The dependencies listed in this document are functional dependencies.
The aim is to provide, for each product, the list of other products needed for its implementation or execution. 


\subsection{Applicable Documents}

Following documents are applicable:

\citeds{LDM-294} Data Management Organization and Management\\
\citeds{LDM-148} Data Management System Design

\subsection{Document Overview}

Information in sections \ref{sec:top} and \ref{sec:sups} is extracted from MagicDraw and provides:

\begin{itemize}
\item the DM top level product tree: it includes all products required to satisfy the DMS requirements.
\item the DM support product tree: it includes all products required for construction and maintenance.
\end{itemize}

The information regarding the Git packages implementing the above products (in sections \ref{sec:top} and \ref{sec:sups}) is provided n section \ref{sec:sups}. 
This informatino is extracted from GitHub.


\newpage
\section{Top Level Product Tree}\label{sec:top}

The products listed in this section are maintained in MagicDraw by the DM System Engineering group. 

These products are meant to be operational, i.e. will process LSST source data and produce L1 or L2 data products, or will be distributed to permit the external collaborators and the science community to provide their contribution to the project.

These products are organized and maintained in MagicDraw by the DM System Engineering group.

\subsection{Data Management Top Level Product}\label{sec:dmtop}

\input{toplevel1}


\newpage
\section{Supporting products}\label{sec:sups}

This section will list all DM products that are not relevant for operations, but that have an important role for construction and maintenance.

These products are organized and maintained in MagicDraw by the DM System Engineering group.

%\input{DMDevProductTree}


\newpage
\section{Low Level Product Tree}\label{sec:low}

This section will list the GitHub packages related to the DM products listed in previous sections \ref{sec:top} and \ref{sec:sups}.

The detailed information for each of them shall be provided in GitHub.

%\input{swProducts}


\newpage
\section{Non DM Products}

This section will list non DM products that are relevant in order to fulfill DMS requirements.
