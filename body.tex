\subsection{Document Overview}

In \ref{sect:top} the list of top level products is provided.
In \ref{sect:low} the list of low level products is provided.
In \ref{sect:deps} the dependencies between the products is provided.
In \ref{sect:sups} the list of supporting software is provided.

\section{Top Level Product Tree}\label{sect:top}

The products listed in this section are maintained in MagicDraw by the DM System Enineering group. 

These products are meant to be operational, i.e. will process LSST source data and produce L1 or L2 data products, or will be distributed to permit the external collaborators and the science community to provide their contribution to the project.

\section{Low Level Product Tree}\label{sect:low}

The products listed in this section are software packages in github.
All information is derived from github content.

These products are implementing mainly the top level \textit{software} products listed in previous \ref{sect:top} and in following \ref{sect:sups}


\section{Supporting products}\label{sect:sups}

The list of products here is not meant to be used for operational puposes, but for supporting all activities involved in the development and maintenance of the operational products. 

These products are organized and maintained in MagicDraw by the DM System Engineering group.


\section{Dependencies}\label{sect:deps}

In this section, the dependencies between different products is put in evidence.
The main purpose of this section is to be able to provide impact analisys capabilities.
